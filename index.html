        <h2>- ABOUT -</h2>
        <p class="about-description">Two years ago, I left finance and a 1+ hour commute to redesign my life. To this day, that was the best decision of my life! <br>
          Since then, I began working remotely for the <a class="work-link" href="https://ccrpc.org/"> Champaign County RPC</a> as an Apprenticeship Specialist.  
          I am helping to redefine Apprenticeships, and open doors for people that have never been given an opportunity in America's workforce. <br>
          I'm working as a freelance marketer for many online and local companies and constantly working to improve my business.
          You can learn more about me, how I give back, or how I learn <a class="book-link" href="books.html">here.</a></p>

            <h3>Design & Development</h3>
            <p>I'm a web designer / developer based in Champaign, Illinois. I have a passion for web design and love to create for web and mobile devices. I began coding in my 20's because I wanted to be 
              a hacker.  Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience and began using it positively.
